            <h1>About Go Dough and the Owners behind it</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Go Dough, where tradition meets innovation in the heart of Canada. Our journey began in the
                bustling streets of Tripoli, Lebanon, where our family has deep roots in the art of traditional baking.
                Faced with economic hardships and corruption in our homeland, we made the difficult decision to leave
                everything behind and seek a new beginning in Canada, following the path laid by our sons.</p>
            <p>Despite the challenges of starting anew in a foreign land, one thing remained constant: our dream of
                sharing the flavors of Lebanon with the world. We knew that opening a bakery was not just a business
                venture for us; it was a way to preserve our heritage, connect with our community, and introduce
                Canadians to the rich culinary traditions of our homeland.</p>
            <p>To ensure that our offerings were truly authentic, we embarked on a journey of discovery and learning. We
                traveled across Lebanon, from the bustling markets of Beirut to the serene valleys of the Bekaa, seeking
                out the best ingredients and techniques. We studied under master bakers who have been perfecting their
                craft for generations, honing our skills and refining our recipes to bring you the most delicious and
                authentic Lebanese delicacies.</p>
            <p>At Go Dough, we pride ourselves on our commitment to quality and authenticity. Our kaake and manousheh
                are made using traditional methods and recipes passed down through generations, ensuring that each bite
                is a taste of Lebanon. But we also believe in innovation, and we are constantly exploring new flavors
                and ideas to keep our menu fresh and exciting.</p>
            <p>Since opening our doors in the dusk of 2023, we have been overwhelmed by the warm reception from the
                community. We are grateful for the opportunity to share a piece of our culture with you and look forward
                to welcoming you to Go Dough, where every bite tells a story of tradition, passion, and love.</p>
